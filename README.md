# myOwnProtoBuf
My personal protobuf practice 
<br/>

Mostly I follow the tutorial from google here https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial
<br/>
General steps to use this : <br/>
1. Clone the project <br/>
2. Setup the protoc compiler <br/>
3. Setup the runtime jar <br/>
4. Compile the .proto file into generated java files <br/>
5. Use the java files to write test <br/>

Detail also refer to my Protobuf Notes https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mDHDalt5wULn7_I-OYbaqyd27YzC3y9pyB2H09rkyk/edit#
